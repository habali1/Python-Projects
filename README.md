# Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository contains a series of projects that showcase different aspects of Python programming, ranging from simple list manipulations to more complex algorithms and games. Each project is designed to highlight specific skills and problem-solving techniques. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects Overview

### **no-01: LIST SUM**
- **Description:** This project involves summing adjacent elements in a list, iteratively reducing the list size until only one element remains. The final result is the sum of all elements in the original list.
- **Key Concepts:** List iteration, in-place modification, reduction algorithms.

### **no-02: XOX**
- **Description:** A simple Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX) game where two players take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 board. The game checks for wins and announces the winner when three marks align.
- **Key Concepts:** Game logic, conditional checks, user input handling.

### **no-03: SHAKING LIST**
- **Description:** This project simulates a list manipulation where users can 'shake' the list to the left or right, summing adjacent elements until only one element remains.
- **Key Concepts:** List manipulation, user-driven control flow, iterative processes.

### **no-04: CONNECT4**
- **Description:** A Python implementation of the classic Connect4 game. Players take turns dropping discs into columns, and the first to align four discs in a row wins.
- **Key Concepts:** Game development, 2D list handling, win condition checks.

### **no-05: MONEY CHANGER**
- **Description:** A simple script that takes an amount of money and displays all possible combinations of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters that sum up to that amount.
- **Key Concepts:** Combinatorial algorithms, nested loops, currency calculations.

### **no-06: HISTOGRAM RANDOM BIG LIST**
- **Description:** This project generates a random list of integers and creates two different histograms, one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis, showing the frequency distribution of the numbers.
- **Key Concepts:** Random number generation, frequency counting, data visualization.

### **no-07: 2048**
- **Description:** A simple implementation of the 2048 game where players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them into a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when no more moves are possible.
- **Key Concepts:** Grid-based game development, random tile generation, sliding puzzle mechanics.

### **no-08: CHESS KNIGHT'S MOVES**
- **Description:** This script simulates the movement of a knight on a chessboard, calculating the average number of moves it takes for the knight to return to its starting position after a large number of random tours.
- **Key Concepts:** Randomized algorithms, chessboard simulations, statistical analysis.

### **no-09: Removing Duplicates with pop()**
- **Description:** A challenging task where duplicate elements in a list are removed using only the `pop()` method, showcasing advanced list manipulation techniques.
- **Key Concepts:** List manipulation, in-place operations, constraint-based problem solving.

## How to Use

Each project is contained within its own folder with a corresponding `README.md` that provides detailed instructions on how to run the code and what to expect. Simply navigate to the project folder you are interested in and follow the instructions.

# no-09: Removing Duplicates with pop()

## Description
This project focuses on a challenging task that involves removing duplicate elements from a list using only the `pop()` method. The goal is to manipulate the list in such a way that all duplicates are removed without using any additional data structures or methods beyond `pop()`.

## Files
- **main.py**: Contains the Python code to remove duplicates from a list using the `pop()` method.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment to see how the list is manipulated and how duplicates are removed.

```bash
python main.py
```
## What I Learned
- **List Manipulation with pop()**: I mastered the technique of removing duplicate elements from a list using only the `pop()` method, which is particularly challenging when attempting to preserve list order and avoid index errors.
- **Nested Loops for Comparison**: This project enhanced my skills in using nested loops for element comparison and manipulation within a list, especially in complex scenarios where multiple elements are identical.
- **Problem Solving under Constraints**: I developed problem-solving strategies under strict constraints, specifically in finding creative solutions to remove duplicates without using additional data structures or methods beyond `pop()`.

# LIST SUM

## Project Description
This Python project demonstrates an algorithm that iteratively sums adjacent elements of a list, reducing the size of the list by half in each iteration until only one element remains. The final element represents the sum of the entire list. The project showcases basic list manipulation, iteration, and the use of mathematical operations in Python.

## Files
- `list_sum.py`: The main Python script that performs the list summation and reduction.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python list_sum.py
   ```
## What I Learned

- **List Manipulation**: I practiced iterating over and modifying lists in Python, learning how to access, update, and reduce lists efficiently.
- **Iteration Techniques**: The project involved nested loops and careful control of iteration to ensure the list was reduced correctly in each step.
- **Mathematical Operations**: I applied basic mathematical operations, such as summation and integer division, to manipulate the list effectively.

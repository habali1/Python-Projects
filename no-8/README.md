# Chess Knight's Moves

## Project Description
This Python project simulates a chess knight's random movement on a chessboard. The goal is to determine the average number of moves it takes for the knight to return to its starting position after a random walk.

## Files
- `chess_knight_moves.py`: The main Python script that contains the simulation of the knight's random moves and the calculation of the average number of moves required to return to the starting position.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python chess_knight_moves.py
   ```
## Observe the Output
The script will simulate the knight's moves and output the average number of moves it takes for the knight to return to its starting position after a large number of random tours (e.g., 100,000 repetitions).
## What I Learned
- **Chess Movement Logic**: I learned how to simulate the movement of a knight on a chessboard, taking into account the unique "L" shape movement of the knight in chess.
- **Random Walk Simulation**: I gained experience in implementing random walk simulations, where a piece moves randomly on a grid.
- **Statistical Data from Simulations**: This project taught me how to aggregate data from repeated simulations to calculate an average value, allowing me to analyze the behavior of the system over time.
- **Efficient Use of Random Functions**: I enhanced my understanding of Pythonâ€™s `random` functions and how to use them to generate random choices that adhere to specific constraints.

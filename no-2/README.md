# XOX

## Project Description
This Python project implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX) game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where players take turns placing their marks (X or O) by entering the coordinates. The game checks for a win condition after each move, determining if a player has successfully aligned three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Files
- `xox.py`: The main Python script that runs the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python xox.py
   ```
2. **Play the game**
- **Players take turns** entering coordinates to place their mark on the board.
- The **first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** wins the game.
## What I Learned

- **Game Logic**: I learned how to implement the core logic of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, including win condition checks and board management.
- **User Interaction**: The project required handling user inputs and updating the game state based on those inputs.
- **Control Structures**: I practiced using control structures like loops and conditionals to manage game flow and determine the winner.

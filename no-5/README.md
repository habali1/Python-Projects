# Money Changer

## Project Description
This Python project implements a money changer function that calculates and displays all possible combinations of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters that sum up to a specified amount of money. The project is useful for understanding how to break down a given amount into various denominations, demonstrating concepts such as loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

## Files
- `money_changer.py`: The main Python script that contains the money changer function.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python money_changer.py
   ```
## Enter the Amount

- **Input the amount of money** you want to change.
- The script will **print out all possible combinations** of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters that sum up to the entered amount.
## What I Learned

- **Nested Loops**: I practiced using nested loops to explore all possible combinations of different coin denominations.
- **Conditional Logic**: The project reinforced my understanding of using conditional statements to check specific criteria, such as whether a combination of coins sums to the desired amount.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: I applied modular arithmetic to calculate the number of each type of coin needed to reach a particular total.

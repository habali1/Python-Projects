# SHAKING LIST

## Project Description
This Python project creates a dynamic list of integers, where the user can "shake" the list by combining either the last two elements or the first two elements based on their input. The list is manipulated until only one element remains, or the user chooses to stop the process. The project demonstrates list manipulation, user input handling, and iterative processing.

## Files
- `shaking_list.py`: The main Python script that runs the shaking list process.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python shaking_list.py
   ```
## Follow the Prompts

- **Enter integers** to add them to the list.
- **Choose to shake the list** to the right (R) or left (L) by summing adjacent elements.
- **Continue shaking** until the list is reduced to a single element or until you decide to stop.
## What I Learned

- **List Manipulation**: I learned how to dynamically modify a list by adding and removing elements based on user input.
- **User Input Handling**: The project required collecting and processing user inputs to control the flow and logic of the program.
- **Iterative Processing**: I practiced using loops to repeatedly modify the list until a certain condition was met or the user chose to exit the loop.

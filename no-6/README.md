# HISTOGRAM RANDOM BIG LIST

## Project Description
This Python project generates a random list of integers between 1 and 10, then creates two different histograms to represent the frequency of each integer in the list. One histogram is displayed horizontally on the x-axis, where the frequency of each number is represented by stars. The other histogram is displayed vertically on the y-axis, showing a vertical representation of the histogram.

## Files
- `histogram_random_big_list.py`: The main Python script that generates the list and creates the histograms.

## Usage
1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python histogram_random_big_list.py
   ```
## View the histograms:

- The script will geberate a random list of integers between 1 and 10.
- It will display two histograms: one on the x-axis (horizontal) and one on the y-axis (vertical).
## What I Learned

- **Histogram Visualization**: I learned how to create and display histograms in both horizontal and vertical formats using text-based representation in Python.
- **Random Number Generation**: The project involved generating a list of random integers, reinforcing my understanding of using Python's `random` module.
- **List and Loop Manipulation**: I practiced iterating through lists and using loops to count occurrences of each integer and display the corresponding histogram.
